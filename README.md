# Mixologist
Hello fellow developer!

The objective of this project was to create an app intergating an API using React and containing the below features:
* Filters
* Search box

API used: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/

The site is styled to give it a look of dimly lighted bar. This is my first React project and the focus was more on displaying my understanding on it.
Would appreciate if you can give any input on optimising the code. Please pop in any ideas in the issues tab. Thank you in advance.
